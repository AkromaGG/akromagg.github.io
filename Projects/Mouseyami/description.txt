I was responsible for 1. Modelling the main character & 2. All of the Unreal Engine implementation, including but not limited to: importing all assets & textures, troubleshooting our rigs & animations due to unforseen compatibility issues & learning how to use Alembic Cache as a solution, snow & mist simulation using the Niagara Particle System, and finally, lighting & rendering.
